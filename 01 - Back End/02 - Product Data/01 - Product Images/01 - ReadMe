Title: Image Processing Automation

Description:
This repository contains a Python script designed for batch processing of images.
It is based on the PIL (Pillow) and rembg libraries, and automates a set of common image processing tasks:

1. Background Removal:
The script utilizes the rembg package to remove the background from each image.
This is particularly useful for processing product images or other images where the main object needs to be isolated.

2. Cropping:
The images are cropped to remove any extra borders around the main object.
This helps in focusing on the main subject of the image.

3. Resizing:
All images are resized to maintain a consistent aspect ratio, with a height of 800 pixels, and the width is calculated based on the original image's aspect ratio.

4. Centering:
The resized image is placed at the center of a new 1000x1000 image with a transparent background.
This ensures that all processed images have a consistent size and the main object is centrally located.

5. Saving:
The final images are saved with a resolution of 300 DPI, which is suitable for high-quality print and display purposes.

The script is designed to process all images in a provided directory, saving the processed images to a separate output directory.
It filters out non-image files and processes images with .jpg, .jpeg, and .png extensions.

To run the script, modify the input_directory and output_directory paths at the end of the script to point to your actual directories.

Please ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
This script specifically requires the Pillow and rembg Python libraries.

Watch out for future updates and improvements to the script.
